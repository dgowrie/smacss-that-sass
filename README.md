# SMACSS that Sass
## A Mobile-First RWD + SMACSS + Sass Boilerplate, FTW!

NUTSHELL:
Get started faster with this mobile-first responsive boilerplate of HTML and SCSS files.

DETAILS: 
"SMACSS that Sass"" is an unprofessional name for a professional front-end boilerplate of *HTML and SCSS files* intended to help me (and you, if you wish to use it) get started faster when building *mobile-first responsive* web sites and apps.

As the project title suggests, this Sass-based boilerplate follows an approach to site development known as [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/), or Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS. Essentially, it is a process of developing with consistent naming conventions and reusable patterns when using CSS.

This project is the product of my 13+ years of web development experience. I have of course learned from, been inspired by, and borrowed heavily from the combined and shared knowledge of the overall community. Some callouts:
